# 📦 Simple CSV Storage API

A FastAPI-based service that lets users upload, store, and download CSV files.

## 🚀 Run the App
 
This project is managed with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a Python package manager that handles isolated environments automatically. To initialize the project, make sure you have `uv` installed:

 ```bash
# Install uv (if needed)
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, restore dependencies with:

```bash
uv sync
```

Once the project is initialized, you can run the app with:

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

### 🧪 Run Tests

Tests are written with `pytest`, which is already defined in the `pyproject.toml`.

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
